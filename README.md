The basic one. Just a modal with a close button. You can put any content in it.

```html
```

### Alert.vue

It imitates a JavaScript `alert()` dialog. This component just adds a "OK" button..

```html
```

### Confirm.vue

It imitates a JavaScript `confirm()` dialog. This component adds "Cancel" and "Confirm" buttons.

```html
```

### Prompt.vue

It imitates a JavaScript `prompt()` dialog. It's just like `Confirm.vue`, but with an input.

```html
```
